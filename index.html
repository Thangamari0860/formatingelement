<b>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph</b></br> 
<strong>is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc.</stong></br> 
<i>In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.</i></br>
<em> A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit</em></br>. 
<u>Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph</u>.</br> 
<q>For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph</q></br>
<mark>can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences</mark>
<del>we will refer to this as the “controlling idea</del> 
<sub>because it controls what happens <sub>in the rest of the paragraph.</sub></br>
<sup>A working thesis functions like<sup> a seed from which your paper</sup></br>
<s>and your ideas, will grow. The whole process is an organic one</s>
